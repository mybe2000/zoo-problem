 <!-- paragraph with a drescription of the animal -->
    <p>Bears can be as small as four feet long and about 60 pounds (the sun bear) to as big as eight feet long and more than a thousand pounds (the polar bear). They're found throughout North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. They have nonretractable claws, short tails, and excellent sense of smell</p>

    <h2><a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/lion">Lions</a></h2>

    <p>Lions have strong, compact bodies and powerful forelegs, teeth and jaws for pulling down and killing prey. Their coats are yellow-gold, and adult males have shaggy manes that range in color from blond to reddish-brown to black. The length and color of a lion's mane is likely determined by age, genetics and hormones</p>

    <h2><a href="https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/monkey">Monkeys</a></h2>

    <p>Monkeys use all four limbs—two arms and two legs—to walk and run. Their hands and feet are good for grasping tree branches. Monkeys have a coat of hair on most of their bodies. Many types have bare areas of skin on the face and buttocks</p>

    <h2><a href="https://myfwc.com/wildlifehabitats/wildlife/alligator/facts/">Alligators</a></h2>

    <p>Alligators have a long, rounded snout that has upward facing nostrils at the end; this allows breathing to occur while the rest of the body is underwater. The young have bright yellow stripes on the tail; adults have dark stripes on the tail. It's easy to distinguish an alligator from a crocodile by the teeth.</p>
